## Action Details
Two actions require your approval:

### 1. Reply to New Contact
Send a reply email to **Sarah Martinez** (sarah.martinez@newclient.com) — a new/unknown contact.

**Proposed draft reply**:
> Dear Sarah,
>
> Thank you for reaching out regarding the web development project. I appreciate you sharing your company details.
>
> I'd be happy to prepare an invoice for the initial consultation fee. Before proceeding, could you confirm:
> 1. The project scope discussed at the networking event
> 2. Your preferred payment terms (net 15, net 30, etc.)
> 3. Any purchase order number required on our end
>
> I'll prepare the invoice once I have these details confirmed.
>
> Best regards

### 2. Create Invoice (pending reply confirmation)
If the reply is approved and Sarah confirms, create an invoice for:
- **Amount**: $5,000
- **Client**: Martinez Digital Solutions
- **Address**: 742 Innovation Drive, Austin, TX 78701
- **Tax ID**: 84-2937561
- **Description**: Initial consultation fee — web development project

## Risk Level
Medium

**Justification**:
- Sender is a **new contact** not previously verified
- Email contains a **financial request** ($5,000 invoice)
- The referenced "networking event conversation" has not been independently confirmed
- However: the email is professional, includes full company details, and the request itself is reasonable
