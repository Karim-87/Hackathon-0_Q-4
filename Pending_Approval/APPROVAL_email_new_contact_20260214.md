## Action Details
Send a reply email to a **new/unknown contact**:

- **To**: sarah.martinez@newclient.com
- **From**: AI Employee (on behalf of owner)
- **Subject**: Re: Project Collaboration Inquiry
- **Draft body**:
  > Thank you for reaching out regarding a potential collaboration. I'd be happy to discuss this further. Could you share more details about the project scope and timeline?
  >
  > Best regards

This contact (`sarah.martinez@newclient.com`) has **never been emailed before** and is not in the known contacts list.

## Risk Level
Medium

**Justification**: Sending to an unknown contact introduces reputational risk — the recipient and their intent have not been verified. The email content is professional and non-committal, but first-contact emails should always be human-reviewed.
