# Monday Briefing — Week of February 10, 2026

## Executive Summary
Strong first week for the AI Employee system. Revenue is at $2,300 of $5,000 monthly target (46%) with 14 days remaining — on pace if the pending $5,000 invoice request converts. Three tasks completed, two approvals still pending your decision, and both watchers are running with zero errors.

## Revenue

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| MTD Revenue | $2,300.00 | $5,000.00 | 46% — Behind pace |
| Invoices Sent | 2 | — | — |
| Invoices Paid | 2/2 | > 90% | 100% |
| Outstanding | $0.00 | — | 0 unpaid |
| Expenses | $80.00 | < $200/mo | On Track |
| Net Income | $2,220.00 | — | — |

**Trend**: $2,300 collected in first 14 days ($2,700 gap to $5,000 target). Invoice payment rate is 100% — well above the 90% target. If the pending $5,000 invoice request from Sarah Martinez is approved and paid, February would exceed target by $2,300. Software costs ($50/mo GitHub) are well under the $200/month budget.

## Completed This Week (3)

| # | Task | Type | Completed | Time to Complete |
|---|------|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | Email reply to Client A (Q1 timeline) | email_send | 2026-02-11 | 5h 15m |
| 2 | Payment received — Client A ($1,500) | payment | 2026-02-12 | 1d 18h |
| 3 | File processing — Q1 Progress Report | file_processing | 2026-02-13 | 8h 25m |

**Completion Rate**: 3/3 completed tasks executed successfully (100%)
**Average time to complete**: 10h 53m
**All executed in DRY_RUN mode** — no live actions were taken.

## Bottlenecks

| Item | Location | Age | Issue |
|------|----------|-----|-------|
| URGENT: Invoice Request (Sarah Martinez) | Pending_Approval | 1 day | $5,000 invoice from new contact — awaiting identity verification and approval |
| test_invoice.txt | Needs_Action/files | 3 days | Test file from watcher validation — no action taken, clogging the queue |
| Sarah Martinez email reply | Pending_Approval | 1 day | Draft reply to new contact waiting for send approval |

**Oldest unresolved item**: test_invoice.txt (3 days) — recommend archiving to `/Done/`.

---

## Pending Approvals (2)

| # | Item | Priority | Waiting Since | Expires |
|---|------|----------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | [[APPROVAL_email_new_contact_invoice_20260214]] | high | 2026-02-14 | 2026-02-15 12:05 |
| 2 | [[APPROVAL_email_new_contact_20260214]] | medium | 2026-02-14 | 2026-02-15 12:00 |

**Action needed**: Both approvals involve new contact Sarah Martinez. The high-priority $5,000 invoice request expires soon — decide before expiration or it will be auto-rejected.

---

## System Health

| Watcher | Status | Items Processed | Errors |
|---------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| GmailWatcher | Active | 1 email | 0 |
| FileSystemWatcher | Active | 1 file | 0 |

- **Total errors this week**: 0
- **Critical issues**: None
- **Rate limit hits**: None
- **Circuit breaker activations**: None

Both watchers are running cleanly. Gmail watcher polling every 2 minutes, filesystem watcher every 5 seconds. No authentication failures, no network timeouts.

---

## Subscription Audit

| Service | Monthly Cost | Last Used | Flag |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------|
| GitHub Team | $50.00 | 2026-02-14 | None — within budget, actively used |

**Total subscription costs**: $50.00/month (well under $200/month target)
**Flagged subscriptions**: None

## Proactive Suggestions

1. **Revenue Opportunity**: The $5,000 invoice request from Sarah Martinez would push February revenue to $7,300 — exceeding the $5,000 target by 46%. Prioritize reviewing this approval before it expires.

2. **Queue Cleanup**: The test_invoice.txt file has been sitting in `Needs_Action` for 3 days. It's a test file with no business value — move to `/Done/` to keep the queue clean and accurate.

3. **Client A Deadline**: The web development retainer project (Client A) has a March 15 milestone. With 29 days remaining, ensure deliverables are on track. Consider creating a project checkpoint in `/Active_Projects/`.

4. **Exit DRY_RUN**: All 3 completed tasks this week ran in DRY_RUN mode. If the system is performing as expected, consider switching to live mode (`DRY_RUN=false` in `.env`) to enable real email sending and payment processing.

5. **Known Contacts**: Create a contacts list so the Gmail watcher can auto-approve drafts to existing clients (Alex Chen, Maria Lopez) without requiring approval for every reply. This would reduce approval overhead for routine communications.
