# Monday Briefing — Week of February 10, 2026

## Executive Summary
The AI Employee system went live this week. Two watchers are active (Filesystem + Gmail), the approval pipeline is operational, and one high-priority email requires your decision: a $5,000 invoice request from a new contact (Sarah Martinez). No revenue was recorded yet — financial tracking needs to be configured.

---

## Revenue

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| MTD Revenue | $0 | N/A — not configured | N/A |
| Invoices Sent | 0 | — | — |
| Invoices Paid | 0/0 | > 90% | N/A |
| Outstanding | $0 | — | 0 unpaid |

**Trend**: Revenue tracking is not yet active. `/Accounting/Current_Month.md` does not exist. A $5,000 invoice request is pending approval — if approved, this would be the first recorded revenue.

---

## Completed This Week (0)

_No tasks were completed this week._

**Completion Rate**: 0/3 planned (0%)

Three plans were created but all are awaiting approval before they can progress.

## Bottlenecks

| Item | Location | Age | Issue |
|------|----------|-----|-------|
| test_invoice.txt review | Pending_Approval | 2 days | File drop from Feb 13 — awaiting disposition decision |
| URGENT: Invoice Request | Pending_Approval | 1 day | High-priority email from new contact — needs human verification |

---

## Pending Approvals (2)

| # | Item | Priority | Waiting Since |
|---|------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | [[APPROVAL_email_new_contact_invoice_20260214]] | high | 2026-02-14 |
| 2 | [[APPROVAL_email_new_contact_20260214]] | medium | 2026-02-14 |

Both approvals involve new contacts. The high-priority item ($5,000 invoice) expires 2026-02-15 12:05 — **action needed before expiration**.

---

## System Health

| Watcher | Status | Items Processed | Errors |
|---------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| GmailWatcher | Active | 1 email | 0 |
| FileSystemWatcher | Active | 1 file | 0 |

- **Total errors this week**: 0
- **Critical issues**: None
- **Rate limit hits**: None

Both watchers are running cleanly with zero errors. The circuit breaker has not been triggered.

## Subscription Audit

Subscription audit data not yet configured. Consider populating `/Accounting/Current_Month.md` with current subscription costs to enable automated tracking and threshold alerts.

---

## Proactive Suggestions

1. **Revenue**: Approve or reject the $5,000 invoice request from Sarah Martinez before it expires. This could be the first recorded revenue for Q1 2026.

2. **Financial Setup**: Create `/Accounting/Current_Month.md` with your monthly revenue target, subscription list, and expense categories. Without this file, the briefing cannot calculate revenue vs target.

3. **Business Goals**: Update `/Business_Goals.md` — the monthly revenue target, software cost budget, and active projects are currently blank placeholders. Fill these in to enable threshold alerts and progress tracking.

4. **Bottleneck**: The test_invoice.txt file has been in `Needs_Action` for 2 days. It's a test file from the watcher pipeline validation — recommend moving to `/Done/` to clear the queue.

5. **Contacts List**: Consider creating a known contacts file so the Gmail watcher can distinguish new vs known contacts. Currently all senders are treated as new, which requires approval for every reply.
